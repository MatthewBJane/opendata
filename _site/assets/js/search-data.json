(2017) *Learning relative values in the striatum induces violations of normative decision making* ``` Publication(s): https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms16033 Data repository: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10718-8#Sec19 ``` The data from 75 participants in a 2-arm bandit task with novel choice contexts introduced throughout the task. Behavior on the task shows agents learn how good an option is relative to an option with which it had previously been paired. ### Lefebvre et al. (2017) *Behavioural and neural characterization of optimistic reinforcement learning* ``` Publication(s): https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-017-0067 Data repository: https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Behavioral_data_and_data_extraction_code/4265408/1 ``` The behavior from 85 participants who performed a simple 2-arm bandit task. ### Swart et al. (2017) *Catecholaminergic challenge uncovers distinct Pavlovian and instrumental mechanisms of motivated (in)action* ``` Publications: https://elifesciences.org/articles/22169/ Data repository: https://elifesciences.org/articles/22169/figures#SD1-data ``` 106 participants on the Pavlovian Instrumental Transfer task. ### Correa et al.

(2019) *Hippocampal pattern separation supports reinforcement learning* ``` Publication(s): https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-08998-1 Data repository: https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds001590 ``` The behavior and fMRI data from 32 participants who performed a configural reinforcement learning task. ### Moran et al. (2019) *Retrospective Model-Based inference Guides Model-Free Credit Assignment* ``` Publication(s): https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-08662-8 Data repository: https://osf.io/8j7yf/ ``` Study of MB retrospective-inference, wherein MB system resolves uncertainty present at the time of choice thereby guiding an MF credit-assignment. ### Zhu et al.

They find that whereas OFC patients are significantly impaired, BG patients show intact learning in the economic game. By contrast, when information about the strategic context is absent, both cohorts are significantly impaired. --- ## Eye-tracking ### Wise et al. (2019) *A computational account of threat-related attentional bias* ``` Publications(s): https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007341 Data repository: https://osf.io/b4e72/ ``` Measures of visual attention through eye-tracking of threatening stimuli in aversive reinforcement learning task. ### Thomas et al.
