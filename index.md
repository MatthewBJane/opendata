# OpenData
<br>
OpenData is a database of publicly available datasets of potential interest to the Niv/Daw labs. We are mostly cataloging datasets involving reinforcement learning & decision making experiment, though we also keep tabs on computational psychiatry experiments and some self-report questionnaires.

To browse the current catalog, follow the links below or use the search bar at the top of this page.

## Site Layout

This site currently has three sections:

[Datasets](/opendata/docs/datasets): the catalog of publicly available datasets, divided into [behavioral](/opendata/docs/datasets/behavior) datasets, [psychiatric](/opendata/docs/datasets/psychiatry) datasets, and [self-report](/opendata/docs/datasets/self-report) datasets.

[Databases](/opendata/docs/databases): other databases, search engines, and resources for finding publicly available data.

[Contribute](/opendata/docs/contribute/): how to submit a dataset for entry to OpenData.
