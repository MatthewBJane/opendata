It presents a meta-analysis (N = 162,636, k = 272) of domain, facet, and item-level correlations between personality and intelligence (general, fluid, and crystallized) for the major Big Five and HEXACO hierarchical frameworks of personality: NEO PI-R, Big Five Aspect Scales (BFAS), BFI-2, and HEXACO PI R. It provides the first meta-analysis of personality and intelligence to comprehensively examine (a) facet-level correlations for these hierarchical frameworks of personality, (b) item-level correlations, (c) domain- and facet-level predictive models. Age and sex differences in personality and intelligence, and study-level moderators, are also examined. The study was complemented by four of our own unpublished datasets (N = 26,813) which were used to assess the ability of item-level models to provide generalizable prediction. Results showed that openness (ρ = .20) and neuroticism (ρ = -.09) were the strongest Big Five correlates of intelligence and that openness correlated more with crystallized than fluid intelligence. At the facet-level, traits related to intellectual engagement and unconventionality were more strongly related to intelligence than other openness facets, and sociability and orderliness were negatively correlated with intelligence. Facets of gregariousness and excitement seeking had stronger negative correlations, and openness to aesthetics, feelings, and values had stronger positive correlations with crystallized than fluid intelligence. Facets explained more than twice the variance of domains. Overall, the results provide the most nuanced and robust evidence to date of the relationship between personality and intelligence.","link":"/opensynthesis/anglim-et-al-2022/"},{"title":"Burgoyne et al.

Here, we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the relationship between cognitive ability and skill in chess. Chess skill correlated positively and significantly with fluid reasoning (Gf) (r = 0.24), comprehension-knowledge (Gc) (r = 0.22), short-term memory (Gsm) (r = 0.25), and processing speed (Gs) (r = 0.24); the meta-analytic average of the correlations was (r = 0.24). Moreover, the correlation between Gf and chess skill was moderated by age (r = 0.32 for youth samples vs. r = 0.11 for adult samples), and skill level (r = 0.32 for unranked samples vs. r = 0.14 for ranked samples). Interestingly, chess skill correlated more strongly with numerical ability (r = 0.35) than with verbal ability (r = 0.19) or visuospatial ability (r = 0.13). The results suggest that cognitive ability contributes meaningfully to individual differences in chess skill, particularly in young chess players and/or at lower levels of skill.","link":"/opensynthesis/burgoyne-et-al-2016/"},{"title":"Burnette et al.

To answer this question properly, the field needs to understand the meaningful heterogeneity in effects. In the present systematic review and meta-analysis, we focused on two key moderators with adequate data to test: Subsamples expected to benefit most and implementation fidelity. We also specified a process model that can be generative for theory. We included articles published between 2002 (first mindset intervention) through the end of 2020 that reported an effect for a growth mindset intervention, used a randomized design, and featured at least one of the qualifying outcomes. Our search yielded 53 independent samples testing distinct interventions. We reported cumulative effect sizes for multiple outcomes (i.e., mindsets, motivation, behavior, end results), with a focus on three primary end results (i.e., improved academic achievement, mental health, or social functioning). Multilevel metaregression analyses with targeted subsamples and high fidelity for academic achievement yielded, d = 0.14, 95% CI [.06, .22]; for mental health, d = 0.32, 95% CI [.10, .54]. Results highlighted the extensive variation in effects to be expected from future interventions. Namely, 95% prediction intervals for focal effects ranged from −0.08 to 0.35 for academic achievement and from 0.07 to 0.57 for mental health. The literature is too nascent for moderators for social functioning, but average effects are d = 0.36, 95% CI [.03, .68], 95% PI [−.50, 1.22]. We conclude with a discussion of heterogeneity and the limitations of meta-analyses.","link":"/opensynthesis/burnette-et-al-2022/"},{"title":"Emslander and Scherer (2022)","text":"| k = 47 studies | 10+ moderators | Correlations | No study quality coding | Psychometric artifact values coded | ABSTRACT: Executive functions (EFs) are key skills underlying other cognitive skills that are relevant to learning andeveryday life. Although a plethora of evidence suggests a positive relation between the three EFsubdimensions, inhibition, shifting, and updating, and math skills for schoolchildren and adults, thefindings on the magnitude of and possible variations in this relation are inconclusive for preschoolchildren and several narrow math skills (i.e., math intelligence). Therefore, the present meta-analysisaimed to (a) synthesize the relation between EFs and math intelligence (an aggregate of math skills) inpreschool children; (b) examine which study, sample, and measurement characteristics moderate thisrelation; and (c) test the joint effects of EFs on math intelligence. Utilizing data extracted from 47 studies (363 effect sizes, 30,481 participants) from 2000 to 2021, we found that, overall, EFs are significantlyrelatedtomathintelligence(r=.34, 95% CI [.31, .37]), as are inhibition (r=.30, 95% CI [.25, .35]),shifting (r=.32, 95% CI [.25, .38]), and updating (r=.36, 95% CI [.31, .40]). Key measurementcharacteristics of EFs, but neither children’s age nor gender, moderated this relation. Thesefindingssuggest a positive link between EFs and math intelligence in preschool children and emphasize theimportance of measurement characteristics. We further examined the joint relations between EFs andmath intelligence via meta-analytic structural equation modeling.

These traits have been linked to certain abilities that may facilitate the attainment of goals in social interactions, one of which may be emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence encompasses the abilities to perceive emotions correctly, to understand the regularities of emotional functioning, and to regulate one’s own and others’ emotions. However, it has alternatively also been conceptualized as a set of emotion-related personality characteristics assessed with self-reports (Trait emotional intelligence). The aim of this study was to examine the possible relationships between the dark triad and emotional intelligence. A meta-analysis with a total of 109 effect sizes (6 ≤ ks ≤ 30) culled from 71 studies was conducted. Of the resulting six most relevant combined effect sizes (1561 ≤ Ns ≤ 8127), five were small and negative (−.23 ≤ r ≤ −.13). Only the correlation between narcissism and emotion-related personality characteristics was small and positive (r = .15). In total, the results indicate that the dark triad constructs are only weakly related to emotion-related traits, either conceptualized as abilities or personality characteristics.","link":"/opensynthesis/michels-and-schulze-2021/"},{"title":"Macnamara and Burgoyne (2022)","text":"| k = 62 studies | 10+ moderators | Standardized Mean Differences | Study quality coded | No psychometric artifact values | ABSTRACT: According to mindset theory, students who believe their personal characteristics can change—that is, those who hold a growth mindset—will achieve more than students who believe their characteristics are fixed. Proponents of the theory have developed interventions to influence students’ mindsets, claiming that these interventions lead to large gains in academic achievement. Despite their popularity, the evidence for growth mindset intervention benefits has not been systematically evaluated considering both the quantity and quality of the evidence. Here, we provide such a review by (a) evaluating empirical studies’ adherence to a set of best practices essential for drawing causal conclusions and (b) conducting three meta-analyses. When examining all studies (63 studies, N = 97,672), we found major shortcomings in study design, analysis, and reporting, and suggestions of researcher and publication bias: Authors with a financial incentive to report positive findings published significantly larger effects than authors without this incentive. Across all studies, we observed a small overall effect: d = 0.05, 95% CI = [0.02, 0.09], which was nonsignificant after correcting for potential publication bias. No theoretically meaningful moderators were significant. When examining only studies demonstrating the intervention influenced students’ mindsets as intended (13 studies, N = 18,355), the effect was nonsignificant: d = 0.04, 95% CI = [−0.01, 0.10]. When examining the highest-quality evidence (6 studies, N = 13,571), the effect was nonsignificant: d = 0.02, 95% CI = [−0.06, 0.10]. We conclude that apparent effects of growth mindset interventions on academic achievement are likely attributable to inadequate study design, reporting flaws, and bias.","link":"/opensynthesis/macnamara-and-burgoyne-2022/"},{"title":"Gerwig et al. (2021)","text":"| k = 112 studies | 10+ moderators | Correlations | No study quality coding | Psychometric artifact values coded | ABSTRACT: This paper provides a meta-analytic update on the relationship between intelligence and divergent thinking (DT), as research on this topic has increased, and methods have diversified since Kims meta-analysis in 2005. A three-level meta-analysis was used to analyze 849 correlation coefficients from 112 studies with an overall N = 34,610. The overall effect showed a significant positive correlation of r = .25. This increase of the correlation as compared to Kim’s prior meta-analytic findings could be attributed to the correction of attenuation because a difference between effect sizes prior-Kim vs. post-Kim was non-significant. Different moderators such as scoring methods, instructional settings, intelligence facets, and task modality were tested together with theoretically relevant interactions between some of these factors. These moderation analyses showed that the intelligence–DT relationship can be higher (up to r = .31–.37) when employing test-like assessments coupled with be-creative instructions, and considering DT originality scores. The facet of intelligence (g vs. gf vs. gc) did not affect the correlation between intelligence and DT. Furthermore, we found two significant sample characteristics: (a) average sample age was positively associated with the intelligence–DT correlation, and (b) the intelligence–DT correlation decreased for samples with increasing percentages of females in the samples. Finally, inter-moderator correlations were checked to take potential confounding into account, and also publication bias was assessed. This meta-analysis provides a comprehensive picture of current research and possible research gaps. Theoretical implications, as well as recommendations for future research, are discussed.","link":"/opensynthesis/gerwig-et-al-2021/"},{"title":"Wiernik and Kostal (2019)","text":"| k = 135 studies | 10+ moderators | Correlations | Study quality coded | Psychometric artifact values coded | ABSTRACT: The protean/boundaryless career concepts refer to people becoming more self-directed and flexible in managing their careers in response to societal shifts in work arrangements. A sizeable literature has emerged on protean/boundaryless career orientations/preferences (PBCO). Questions remain, however, about the structure of PBCO and whether they predict important criteria. The PBCO literature is largely disconnected from broader individual-level career research, making it unclear how PBCO intersect with career models based on other characteristics. We address these questions by systematically reviewing/meta-analyzing PBCO research. Based on 135 demographically/occupationally-diverse samples from 35 countries (45,288 individuals), we find no support for traditional distinctions between protean and boundaryless orientations—protean self-directed, protean values-driven, and boundaryless psychological mobility all load onto a single general factor, labelled “proactive career orientation”, and are only weakly related to boundaryless physical mobility preferences. We also find PBCO predict career self-management behaviors and satisfaction but are less related to non-career-focused attitudes, objective success, or physical mobility behavior. PBCO are strongly related to proactivity-related and self-efficacy personality traits. We use these findings to propose an integrative model for how PBCO and other dispositions mutually influence career behavior. We discuss when PBCO may have advantages over broad traits for understanding careers, implications for counseling practice, and directions for future research.","link":"/opensynthesis/wiernik-and-kostal-2019/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Personality","slug":"Personality","link":"/opensynthesis/tags/Personality/"},{"name":"Intelligence","slug":"Intelligence","link":"/opensynthesis/tags/Intelligence/"},{"name":"Observational","slug":"Observational","link":"/opensynthesis/tags/Observational/"},{"name":"Chess","slug":"Chess","link":"/opensynthesis/tags/Chess/"},{"name":"Growth Mindset","slug":"Growth-Mindset","link":"/opensynthesis/tags/Growth-Mindset/"},{"name":"Education","slug":"Education","link":"/opensynthesis/tags/Education/"},{"name":"Intervention","slug":"Intervention","link":"/opensynthesis/tags/Intervention/"},{"name":"Executive Functions","slug":"Executive-Functions","link":"/opensynthesis/tags/Executive-Functions/"},{"name":"Math","slug":"Math","link":"/opensynthesis/tags/Math/"},{"name":"Cognitive","slug":"Cognitive","link":"/opensynthesis/tags/Cognitive/"},{"name":"Emotional Intelligence","slug":"Emotional-Intelligence","link":"/opensynthesis/tags/Emotional-Intelligence/"},{"name":"Dark Triad","slug":"Dark-Triad","link":"/opensynthesis/tags/Dark-Triad/"},{"name":"Creativity/Divergent Thinking","slug":"Creativity-Divergent-Thinking","link":"/opensynthesis/tags/Creativity-Divergent-Thinking/"},{"name":"Industrial/Organizational","slug":"Industrial-Organizational","link":"/opensynthesis/tags/Industrial-Organizational/"},{"name":"Protean/Boundaryless Orientations","slug":"Protean-Boundaryless-Orientations","link":"/opensynthesis/tags/Protean-Boundaryless-Orientations/"}],"categories":[]}
