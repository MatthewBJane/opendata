{"pages":[{"title":"About OpenSynthesis","text":"OpenSynthesis is a database of publicly available meta-analytic datasets. OpenSynthesis is the sister site to OpenData. To browse the database, click on the links above or use the search bar at the top-right of this page. What is the goal of OpenSynthesis? The goal of this project is simply to make it easier for researchers to find and use publicly available meta-analytic databases as part of research. There's already so much out there that can be used to: Test new hypotheses or models Assess new statistical methods with existing datasets Update previously published meta-analyses Conduct meta-meta-analyses (or meta-reviews) Provide meta-analysis examples meta-analytic for pedogogical purposes What is the scope of OpenSynthesis? The scope of this project is to catalogue any and all open meta-analytic databases related to, generally, psychological sciences. The only firm requirement is that each database is a synthesis of multiple studies. Who maintains OpenSynthesis? This project is maintained by Matthew B. Jané with help from Sam Zorowitz. How can I add a dataset? Please see the contributing page. How can I report an issue? Please open an issue on our Github or directly contact the maintainer.","link":"/opensynthesis/about/index.html"},{"title":"Contribute to OpenSynthesis","text":"Contributions to OpenSynthesis are welcome! All of the code is managed through the GitHub repository. How to submit a dataset There are three main ways you can submit a dataset for entry to OpenSynthesis, which are described in turn below. Note that they are ranked in order of preference, from most preferred to least preferred, by the maintainers of OpenSynthesis. 1. Fill out the Google form Have a dataset to submit? Fill out this form: https://forms.gle/N87Dqhs73vbfoPec8 Loading… 2. Submit a pull request To directly add a dataset yourself, you can open a pull request on Github. First you should fork the OpenSynthesis library via GitHub and make modifications on your fork. The OpenSynthesis database is written in markdown using a standardized, easy-to-copy template. Once your modification is complete, submit a pull request to merge your changes into the docs branch of OpenSynthesis. Pull requests will be reviewed by the maintainers. 3. Open an issue To advertise a dataset for entry into the database, you can open a new issue via GitHub. Please provide a link to a repository for the data and, if available, a link to a corresponding manuscript describing the data.","link":"/opensynthesis/contribute/index.html"}],"posts":[{"title":"Brunette et al. (2022)","text":"(k = 53 independent samples) As growth mindset interventions increase in scope and popularity, scientists and policymakers are asking: Are these interventions effective? To answer this question properly, the field needs to understand the meaningful heterogeneity in effects. In the present systematic review and meta-analysis, we focused on two key moderators with adequate data to test: Subsamples expected to benefit most and implementation fidelity. We also specified a process model that can be generative for theory. We included articles published between 2002 (first mindset intervention) through the end of 2020 that reported an effect for a growth mindset intervention, used a randomized design, and featured at least one of the qualifying outcomes. Our search yielded 53 independent samples testing distinct interventions. We reported cumulative effect sizes for multiple outcomes (i.e., mindsets, motivation, behavior, end results), with a focus on three primary end results (i.e., improved academic achievement, mental health, or social functioning). Multilevel metaregres- sion analyses with targeted subsamples and high fidelity for academic achievement yielded, d = 0.14, 95% CI [.06, .22]; for mental health, d = 0.32, 95% CI [.10, .54]. Results highlighted the extensive variation in effects to be expected from future interventions. Namely, 95% prediction intervals for focal effects ranged from −0.08 to 0.35 for academic achievement and from 0.07 to 0.57 for mental health. The literature is too nascent for moderators for social functioning, but average effects are d = 0.36, 95% CI [.03, .68], 95% PI [−.50, 1.22]. We conclude with a discussion of heterogeneity and the limitations of meta-analyses.","link":"/opensynthesis/brunette-et-al-2022/"},{"title":"Wiernik and Kostal (2019)","text":"(k = 135 independent samples) The protean/boundaryless career concepts refer to people becoming more self-directed and flexible in managing their careers in response to societal shifts in work arrangements. A sizeable literature has emerged on protean/boundaryless career orientations/preferences (PBCO). Questions remain, however, about the structure of PBCO and whether they predict important criteria. The PBCO literature is largely disconnected from broader individual-level career research, making it unclear how PBCO intersect with career models based on other characteristics. We address these questions by systematically reviewing/meta-analyzing PBCO research. Based on 135 demographically/occupationally-diverse samples from 35 countries (45,288 individuals), we find no support for traditional distinctions between protean and boundaryless orientations—protean self-directed, protean values-driven, and boundaryless psychological mobility all load onto a single general factor, labelled “proactive career orientation”, and are only weakly related to boundaryless physical mobility preferences. We also find PBCO predict career self-management behaviors and satisfaction but are less related to non-career-focused attitudes, objective success, or physical mobility behavior. PBCO are strongly related to proactivity-related and self-efficacy personality traits. We use these findings to propose an integrative model for how PBCO and other dispositions mutually influence career behavior. We discuss when PBCO may have advantages over broad traits for understanding careers, implications for counseling practice, and directions for future research.","link":"/opensynthesis/wiernik-and-kostal-2019/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Multiple Types of Effect Sizes","slug":"Multiple-Types-of-Effect-Sizes","link":"/opensynthesis/tags/Multiple-Types-of-Effect-Sizes/"},{"name":"10+ moderators","slug":"10-moderators","link":"/opensynthesis/tags/10-moderators/"},{"name":"Medium Size Database (30-100 samples)","slug":"Medium-Size-Database-30-100-samples","link":"/opensynthesis/tags/Medium-Size-Database-30-100-samples/"},{"name":"Methodological Quality Included","slug":"Methodological-Quality-Included","link":"/opensynthesis/tags/Methodological-Quality-Included/"},{"name":"Mixed (Experimental and Observational)","slug":"Mixed-Experimental-and-Observational","link":"/opensynthesis/tags/Mixed-Experimental-and-Observational/"},{"name":"Artifacts Included","slug":"Artifacts-Included","link":"/opensynthesis/tags/Artifacts-Included/"},{"name":"Correlational","slug":"Correlational","link":"/opensynthesis/tags/Correlational/"},{"name":"5-10 moderators","slug":"5-10-moderators","link":"/opensynthesis/tags/5-10-moderators/"},{"name":"Large Database","slug":"Large-Database","link":"/opensynthesis/tags/Large-Database/"},{"name":"No Methodological Quality","slug":"No-Methodological-Quality","link":"/opensynthesis/tags/No-Methodological-Quality/"},{"name":"Observational","slug":"Observational","link":"/opensynthesis/tags/Observational/"}],"categories":[]}
