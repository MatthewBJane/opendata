{"pages":[{"title":"About OpenData","text":"OpenData is a database of publicly available datasets of potential interest to the Niv/Daw labs. We are mostly cataloging datasets involving reinforcement learning &amp; decision making experiment, though we also keep tabs on computational psychiatry experiments and some self-report questionnaires. To browse the current catalog, follow the links above or use the search bar at the top-right of this page.","link":"/opendata/about/index.html"},{"title":"Contributing to OpenData","text":"Contributions to OpenData are welcome! All of the code is managed through the GitHub repository. How to submit a datasetThere are three main ways you can submit a dataset for entry to OpenData, which are described in turn below. Note that they are ranked in order of preference, from most preferred to least preferred, by the maintainers of Open Data :) 1. Submit a pull requestTo directly add a dataset yourself, you can open a pull request on Github. First you should fork the OpenData library via GitHub and make modifications on your fork. The OpenData database is written in markdown using a standardized, easy-to-copy template. Once your modification is complete, submit a pull request to merge your changes into the docs branch of OpenData. Pull requests will be reviewed by the maintainers. 2. Open an issueTo advertise a dataset for entry into the database, you can open a new issue via GitHub. Please provide a link to a repository for the data and, if available, a link to a corresponding manuscript describing the data. 3. Email the maintainersA third and final way to advertise a dataset for entry into the database is to email the maintainers directly (zorowitz@princeton.edu). Please provide a link to a repository for the data and, if available, a link to a corresponding manuscript describing the data.","link":"/opendata/contribute/index.html"}],"posts":[{"title":"Albrecht et al.
