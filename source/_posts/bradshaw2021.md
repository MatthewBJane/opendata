Data from a study in which N=192 participants completed a 2-arm bandit task in which participants chose between pairs of human or slot machine targets. Bandits varied in reward value and generosity of their payouts. Targets were either auditory (voices or tones; Experiment 1) or visual (faces or icons; Experiment 2).
