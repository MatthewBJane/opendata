Data from a study in which N=80 participants completed an approach/avoidance task in which they chose between a CSâˆ’/low reward and a CS+/high reward option. For the latter, probability of CS+ presentation (Pavlovian fear information) and reward magnitude (reward information) varied. Computer mouse movements were tracked to capture the decision dynamics. Participants also completed multiple self-report psychiatric symptom measures.
