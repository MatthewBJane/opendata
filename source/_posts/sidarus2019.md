Data from a study in which N=20 participants completed a probabilistic reversal learning task with embedded irrelevant distractors (flanker arrows). Participants learned to adapt their choices to maximize rewards, but were nevertheless biased to follow the suggestions of irrelevant distractors. Thus, the perceived cost of investing cognitive control to suppress an external suggestion could sometimes trump internal value representations.
