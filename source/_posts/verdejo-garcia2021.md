Data from a study in which N=1697 participants completed a battery of three tasks designed to measure rapid-response impulsive behaviours (disinhibition) as arising from the failure of three distinct cognitive mechanisms: attentional control, information gathering and monitoring/shifting. Data on the Iowa gambling task, beads task, and sustained attention task task was also collected.
