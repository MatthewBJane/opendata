Data from a study in which N=90 participants (ages 8â€“25) completed a task that covertly alternated between controllable and uncontrollable conditions, requiring them to explore different actions to discover the current degree of environmental controllability. While children were able to distinguish controllable and uncontrollable conditions, accuracy of controllability assessments improved with age.
