Data from a study in which N=817 participants across two studies (N=344, N=473) completed either a perceptual decision-making task or a knowledge decision task and rated their confidence about their performance. Participants also completed a number of self-report psychiatric symptom questionnaires. A dimension characterized by compulsivity and intrusive thoughts was found to be associated with reduced objective accuracy but, paradoxically, increased absolute confidence, whereas a dimension characterized by anxiety and depression was associated with systematically low confidence in the absence of impairments in objective accuracy.
