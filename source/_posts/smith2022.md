Data from a study in which N=72 children completed a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm where they saw five colored shapes followed by either appetitive, aversive, or neutral reinforcers. After the conditioning task, participants completed a behavioral choice task in which they were asked to use information from the conditioning task to approach or avoid appetitive and aversive stimuli.
