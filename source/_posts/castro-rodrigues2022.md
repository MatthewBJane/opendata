Data from a study in which N=204 participants (healthy controls = 109, OCD = 46, mood and anxiety disorders = 49) completed a simplified version of two-step task requiring minimal prior instruction. Model-based control emerged with experience in a minority of participants, and less in those with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Providing task structure information strongly increased model-based control, similarly across all groups.
