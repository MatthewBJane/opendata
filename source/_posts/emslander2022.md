Although a plethora of evidence suggests a positive relation between the three EFsubdimensions, inhibition, shifting, and updating, and math skills for schoolchildren and adults, thefindings on the magnitude of and possible variations in this relation are inconclusive for preschoolchildren and several narrow math skills (i.e., math intelligence). Therefore, the present meta-analysisaimed to (a) synthesize the relation between EFs and math intelligence (an aggregate of math skills) inpreschool children; (b) examine which study, sample, and measurement characteristics moderate thisrelation; and (c) test the joint effects of EFs on math intelligence. Utilizing data extracted from 47 studies (363 effect sizes, 30,481 participants) from 2000 to 2021, we found that, overall, EFs are significantlyrelatedtomathintelligence(r=.34, 95% CI [.31, .37]), as are inhibition (r=.30, 95% CI [.25, .35]),shifting (r=.32, 95% CI [.25, .38]), and updating (r=.36, 95% CI [.31, .40]). Key measurementcharacteristics of EFs, but neither childrenâ€™s age nor gender, moderated this relation. Thesefindingssuggest a positive link between EFs and math intelligence in preschool children and emphasize theimportance of measurement characteristics. We further examined the joint relations between EFs andmath intelligence via meta-analytic structural equation modeling. Evaluating different models andrepresentations of EFs, we did notfind support for the expectation that the three EF subdimensionsare differentially related to math intelligence
