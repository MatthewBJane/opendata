Data from a study in which N=1280 online participants performed a free association task in which they typed whatever words came to mind, as they came to mind, for 5-minutes. Free association was performed before and after a variety of tasks including reading stories of varying levels of coherence (e.g., intact, sentence-scrambled, word-scrambled).
