Data from a study in which N=331 participants completed an advice-giving task in which a client seeks advice about which colored ball to bet on in a lottery, and two advisers compete for influence over the client's decisions. Social anxiety levels are related to the tendency to give advice resembling the advice given by rival advisers and to refrain from status-seeking behavior.
