| Number of studies (k): 31 | Effect Size: Standardized Mean Differences | **ABSTRACT:** Speech-in-noise perception, the ability to hear a relevant voice within a noisy background, is important for successful communication. Musicians have been reported to perform better than non-musicians on speech-in-noise tasks. This meta-analysis uses a multi-level design to assess the claim that musicians have superior speech-in-noise abilities compared to non-musicians. Across 31 studies and 62 effect sizes, the overall effect of musician status on speech-in-noise ability is significant, with a moderate effect size (g = 0.58), 95% CI [0.42, 0.74]. The overall effect of musician status was not moderated by within-study IQ equivalence, target stimulus, target contextual information, type of background noise, or age. We conclude that musicians show superior speech-in-noise abilities compared to non-musicians, not modified by age, IQ, or speech task parameters. These effects may reflect changes due to music training or predisposed auditory advantages that encourage musicianship.
