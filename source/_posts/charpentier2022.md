Data from a study in which N=1155 participants across three experiments (N=1065, N=42, N=48) completed several self-report measures of anxiety and information seeking behaviors in the real world. A smaller subset of participants completed a stock market task in which participants bid for a chance to know (or remain ignorant about) the value of their portfolio, indicating how much they were willing to pay to receive this information or to avoid it.
