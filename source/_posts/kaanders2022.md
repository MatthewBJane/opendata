Data from a study in which N=53 participants across two experiments (N=30, N=23) completed a perceptual decision-making task in which they were briefly presented with stimuli and asked which of the two contained the most dots. After, participants could freely sample (i.e., see) each dot patch. They were asked to rate their confidence before and after the free sampling phase.
