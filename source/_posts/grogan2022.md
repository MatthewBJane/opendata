Data from a study in which N=214 participants across six experiments (N=33, N=34, N=30, N=30, N=74, N=15) completed an orientation working memory task with monetary incentives. Motivational improvements in WM were found even when all items were rewarded. Findings suggest this was not due to better memory precision, but rather better selection of the probed item within memory.
