Data from a study in which N=1000 participants completed paired-associate learning experiments in which the semantic relatedness between initial and later cues, initial and later targets, or both, were systematically varied. Learning retroactively benefited long-term memory performance for semantically related words (vs. unshown control words), and these benefits increased as a function of relatedness.
