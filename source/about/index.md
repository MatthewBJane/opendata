<h2 style="margin: 1em 0em 0.5em 0em">What is the goal of OpenSynthesis?</h2>
The goal of this project is simply to make it easier for researchers to find and use publicly available meta-analytic databases as part of research. There's already so much out there that can be used to:

- Test new hypotheses or models
- Assess new statistical methods with existing datasets
- Update previously published meta-analyses
- Conduct meta-meta-analyses (or meta-reviews)
- Provide meta-analysis examples meta-analytic for pedogogical purposes

<h2 style="margin: 1em 0em 0.5em 0em">What is the scope of OpenSynthesis?</h2>
The scope of this project is to catalogue any and all open meta-analytic databases related to, generally, psychological sciences. The only firm requirement is that each database is a synthesis of multiple studies.
