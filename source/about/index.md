OpenData is a database of publicly available datasets curated by the Niv lab. We mostly catalogue datasets involving reinforcement learning & decision making, though we also include datasets with relevance to computational psychiatry experiments (e.g. self-report questionnaires).

To browse the current catalog, follow the links above or use the search bar at the top-right of this page.
