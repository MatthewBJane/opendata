OpenSynthesis is a database of publicly available meta-analytic datasets. To browse the database, click on the links above or use the search bar at the top-right of this page.

<h2 style="margin: 1em 0em 0.5em 0em">What is the goal of OpenSynthesis?</h2>
The goal of this project is simply to make it easier for researchers to find and use publicly available meta-analytic (i.e., effect size) data as part of research. There's already so much out there that can be used to:

- Test new hypotheses or models
- Re-anal
- Create meta-analysis demonstrations for teaching

<h2 style="margin: 1em 0em 0.5em 0em">What is the scope of OpenSynthesis?</h2>
The scope of this project is to catalogue any and all open datasets involving experimental or cognitive tasks (e.g., Stroop, delay discounting, 2-arm bandits). Datasets involving more naturalistic behaviors are also welcomed. The only firm requirement is that trial-level data must be available.
