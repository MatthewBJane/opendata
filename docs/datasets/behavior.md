## Reinforcement Learning

### Klein et al. (2017)
*Learning relative values in the striatum induces violations of normative decision making*
```
Publication(s): https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms16033
Data repository: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10718-8#Sec19
```

The data from 75 participants in a 2-arm bandit task with novel choice contexts introduced throughout the task. Behavior on the task shows agents learn how good an option is relative to an option with which it had previously been paired.

### Lefebvre et al. (2017)
*Behavioural and neural characterization of optimistic reinforcement learning*
```
Publication(s): https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-017-0067
Data repository: https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Behavioral_data_and_data_extraction_code/4265408/1
```

The behavior from 85 participants who performed a simple 2-arm bandit task.

### Swart et al. (2017)
*Catecholaminergic challenge uncovers distinct Pavlovian and instrumental mechanisms of motivated (in)action*
```
Publications: https://elifesciences.org/articles/22169/
Data repository: https://elifesciences.org/articles/22169/figures#SD1-data
```

106 participants on the Pavlovian Instrumental Transfer task.

### Correa et al. (2018)
*How the Level of Reward Awareness Changes the Computational and Electrophysiological Signatures of Reinforcement Learning*
```
Publication(s): https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0457-18.2018
Data repository: https://figshare.com/articles/Codes_and_Data_-_Correa_et_al_JNeuro_2018/7987100
```

A study investigating the effects of stimulus visibility on reward learning and choice.

### Swart et al. (2018)
*Frontal network dynamics reflect neurocomputational mechanisms for reducing maladaptive biases in motivated action*
```
Publications(s): https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2005979
Data repository: https://data.donders.ru.nl/collections/di/dccn/DSC_3017033.03_624?0
```

34 participants on the Pavlovian Instrumental Transfer task.

### Wu et al. (2018)
*Generalization guides human exploration in vast decision spaces*
```
Publication(s): https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-018-0467-4
Data repository: https://github.com/charleywu/gridsearch
```

Study of human exploration in environments with spatially correlated patterns of rewards.

### Ballard et al. (2019)
*Hippocampal pattern separation supports reinforcement learning*
```
Publication(s): https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-08998-1

### Moran et al. (2019)
*Retrospective Model-Based inference Guides Model-Free Credit Assignment*
```
Publication(s): https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-08662-8

```

Study of MB retrospective-inference, wherein MB system resolves uncertainty present at the time of choice thereby guiding an MF credit-assignment.

### Zhu et al. (2019)
*Patients with basal ganglia damage show preserved learning in an economic game*
```
Publications(s): https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-08766-1
Data repository: https://osf.io/4x3nf/
```
Study of the behavior of patients with focal lesions to either basal ganglia or orbitofrontal cortex in a multi-strategy competitive game known to engage these regions. They find that whereas OFC patients are significantly impaired, BG patients show intact learning in the economic game. By contrast, when information about the strategic context is absent, both cohorts are significantly impaired.
