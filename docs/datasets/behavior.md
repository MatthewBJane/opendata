This resource consists of data from a risky decision and happiness task that was part of The Great Brain Experiment (GBE) smartphone app. Data were collected from 47,067 participants aged 18+ between March 8, 2013 and October 5, 2015. These anonymous unpaid participants completed the task a total of 91,058 times making approximately 2.7 million choices and 1.1 million happiness ratings in total. This resource represents at least 6,000 hours of task data. A subset of 1,858 participants also completed a depression questionnaire and answered five questions about their depression history.
