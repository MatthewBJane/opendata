#### [Wulff et al. (2018)](https://zenodo.org/record/1491449): A meta-analytic review of two modes of learning and the description-experience gap
The data of 28 publications studying the description-experience gap, involving experience- and description-based risky choices, that served as the basis for the meta analysis reported in Wulff et al. (2018). A meta-analytic review of two modes of learning and the description-experience gap. Psychological Bulletin, 144(2), 140-176.

### Stationary Bandit Task

#### [Lefebvre et al. (2017)](https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.4265408.v1): Behavioural and neural characterization of optimistic reinforcement learning
A study of learning rate asymmetry in a simple stationary probabilistic bandit task. fMRI data available [here](http://neurovault.org/collections/2195/).

Reference-dependent value learning in stationary bandits. 

### Model-based Inference

#### [Wu et al. (2018)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0467-4): Generalization guides human exploration in vast decision spaces
Value generalization using Gaussian process function learning. Data available [here](https://github.com/charleywu/gridsearch).

#### [Moran et al. (2019)](https://osf.io/8j7yf/?view_only=8362bdb2672643de98daaa8e509aae30): Retrospective Model-Based inference Guides Model-Free Credit Assignment
Study of MB retrospective-inference, wherein MB system resolves uncertainty present at the time of choice thereby guiding an MF credit-assignment.

### Eye-tracking

#### [Thomas et al. (2019)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0584-8#data-availability): Gaze bias differences capture individual choice behaviour
An investigation of the strength of the relationship between eye gaze and choice across four different simple choice experiments. They report that an association between gaze and choice is present for most individuals, but differs considerably in strength.

### Perception & RL

#### [Correa et al. (2018)](https://figshare.com/articles/Codes_and_Data_-_Correa_et_al_JNeuro_2018/7987100): How the Level of Reward Awareness Changes the Computational and Electrophysiological Signatures of Reinforcement Learning
Modulating perceptual awareness of reward changes reinforcement learning.

### Multi-agent RL

#### [Zhu et al. (2019)](https://osf.io/4x3nf/): Patients with basal ganglia damage show preserved learning in an economic game
Study of the behavior of patients with focal lesions to either BG or OFC in a multi-strategy competitive game known to engage these regions. We find that whereas OFC patients are significantly impaired, BG patients show intact learning in the economic game. By contrast, when information about the strategic context is absent, both cohorts are significantly impaired.
