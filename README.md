## Data Repositories <a name="Repositories"></a>
### [OpenNeuro](https://openneuro.org/)
Large repository of human neuroimaging data (e.g. fMRI, EEG, DTI). Many different tasks available, often with high-quality behavioral data. 

### [Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience](http://crcns.org/data-sets)
Repository of high quality datasets valuable for testing computational models of the brain and new analysis methods. The data include physiological recordings from sensory and memory systems, as well as eye movement data. 

### [Open Psychometrics](https://openpsychometrics.org/_rawdata/)
Large open collection of standard psychological surveys. Useful for developing structured covariance models and dimensionality reduction techniques. 

### [Journal of Open Psychology Data](https://openpsychologydata.metajnl.com/)
The Journal of Open Psychology Data (JOPD) features peer reviewed data papers describing psychology datasets with high reuse potential.

## Learning & Decision Making <a name="rldm"></a>

### Decisions from Description

#### [Calibration Data for Choice Prediction Competition 2018](https://zenodo.org/record/845873#.WeDg9GhSw2x)

The complete raw data from a choice prediction competition for decisions under risk, under ambiguity, and from experience. The data includes 510,750  choices of human decision makers choosing between two risky and/or uncertain prospects with up to 10 possible outcomes each. These data are described in greater detail in [Erev et al. (2017)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28277716).

## Computational Psychiatry <a name="psychiatry"></a>

### Reinforcement Learning

#### [Aylward et al., Submitted](https://osf.io/ub6j7/)
This repository contains all the data for *Altered decision-making under uncertainty in unmedicated mood and anxiety disorders*. This manuscript looked at exploratory and learning behaviors in healthy and anxious individuals in a 4-arm restless bandit task with both rewards and punishments.

#### [Homan et al. (2019)](https://github.com/philipphoman/comp)
This repository contains all the data and analysis code to reproduce the manuscript *[Neural computations of threat in the aftermath of combat trauma](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0315-x)*, which fit Pearce-Hall style models to patients wiht post-traumatic stress disorder. 

### Experience Sampling

#### [Kossakowski et al. (2017)](https://openpsychologydata.metajnl.com/articles/10.5334/jopd.29/)
Dataset of a single (N = 1) participant diagnosed with major depressive disorder, who completed 1478 measurements over the course of 239 consecutive days in 2012 and 2013. The items, which were asked ten times a day, cover topics like mood, physical condition and social contacts. 

#### [Fisher et al. (2017)](https://osf.io/zefbc/)
Dataset of 40 individuals with  generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and/or major depressive disorder (MDD). Participants reported their momentary experience of 21 items related to mood and anxiety psychopathology 4x/day for approximately 30 days. To date, the average number of completed surveys has been 130.43 (SD = 19.27), with a range from 87 to 212.
